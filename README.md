# Blockchain Concept Demonstration
A class project that is meant to provide a demonstration of a blockchain's value to an organization as an alternative to a traditional database. 
It is being created by myself and classmates for our Applications in Information Security course.

#Summary
It is not a real use case of Blockchain, but it is rather a way to simulate a blockchain and its concepts on one machine. 

#Resources
The initial concept of the project was inspired by this article on C# corner: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/blockchain-basics-building-a-blockchain-in-net-core/
